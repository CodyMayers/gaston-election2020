# Gaston County 2020 election results

Within the **data** folder above, there are 4 subfolders, each one corresponding to a dataset on the NC SBE Downloads page (see **Source** below).

Each subfolder contains:

* The original .txt or .csv file you can download from the Downloads page.*
* A schema.txt file which has a description of the file, as well as what each column means.
* The data in an Excel (.xlsx) format, narrowed down to just Gaston County and sorted by Precinct, Total Votes and other columns as appropriate.

###### * The only exception to this is the original .csv for Absentee Data, which is too large to store.
